"Used 38 registers, used 1 barriers, 2048 bytes smem, 424 bytes cmem[0]"
From DeviceQuery the NVIDIA Geforce RTX 2060 Super has
34 Multiprocessors 
1024 max number of threads per multiprocessor and per block
49152 bytes per shared memory per block
65536 bytes or registers per block

To calculate how many threads can be scheduled simultaneously on the Wilkinson GPU, we need to identify first the number of blocks that can run on one SM. Since our TILE_SIZE was 16x16, our kernel has 256 threads. Each thread uses 38 registers, so 38 * 256 is 9,728 registers per thread block. Since there are 65536 registers per SM, based on just the register limit, each SM can support 65536/9,728 ≈ 6 blocks. However, this register limit is not the limiting factor due to the following calculations. Each thread block in our kernel uses 2048 bytes out of the max 65,536 bytes in a SM, so 65536/2048 = 32 blocks (however, each SM has a max of 16 blocks simultaneously, so shared memory is not a limiting factor). The only remaining limiting factor is that since each SM can simultaneously run 1024 threads and each thread block in our kernel uses 16*16=256 threads, only 1024/256 = 4 thread blocks can run simultaneously. Since there are 34 SMs for the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER, we can run 34 * 4 = 136 thread blocks in parallel. Since each thread block is 256 threads, that would make our final calculation 34,816 threads that can run simultaneously.
