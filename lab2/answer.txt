"Used 38 registers, used 1 barriers, 2048 bytes smem, 424 bytes cmem[0]"
To calculate how many threads can be scheduled simultaneously on the Wilkenson GPU, we need to identify first the number of blocks that can run on 
one SM. Since our TILE_SIZE was 16x16, our kernel had 256 threads. Each thread uses 38 registers, so 38 * 256 is 9,728 registers per thread block. Since there are 65536 registers per SM, based on just the register limit, each SM can support 65536/38 ≈ 1,724 threads (however, the max number of threads per SM is 1024, so register is not a limiting factor). Each thread block in our kernel uses 2048 bytes out of the max 65,536 bytes in a SM, so 65536/2048 = 32 blocks (however, each SM has a max of 16 blocks simultaneously, so shared memory is not a limiting factor). The only remaining limiting factor is that since each SM can simultaneously run 1024 threads and each thread block in our kernel uses 16*16=256 threads, only 1024/256 = 4 thread blocks can run simultaneously. Since there are 34 SMs for the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER, we can run 34 * 4 = 136 thread blocks in parallel. Since each thread block is 256 threads, that would make our final calculation 34,816 threads that can run simultaneously.
